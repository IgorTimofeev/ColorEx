# ColorEx

This library is designed for convenient processing of color channels in the most popular ways. There are no custom color structures, no redundant casts, no value converters - just basic math on fractional numbers. Simple, like all things should be.

The code part is divided into 2 static classes - **Rgb** and **Hsb**, each of which is responsible for operations on its own color model
